            <div class="" style="display:flex;gap:1rem">
                <img src="/trademeda/static/src/img/abhishek.png"/>
                <p class="">Trademeda originates from the vision of Mr. Abhishek
Kumar, who is a software engineering graduate. In
addition to his engineering background, he holds
postgraduate qualifications in both marketing and
finance, and has undergone specialized training in
export-import at the prestigious Indian Institute of
Foreign Trade in Delhi. He has accumulated extensive
experience working with export-import companies,
gaining valuable insights into the challenges faced by
exporters, importers, and traders in establishing
reliable business partnerships, both locally and
internationally.
Building upon his wealth of experience in the export-import sector, Mr.
Kumar conceptualized a unified online platform aimed at facilitating
seamless connections between buyers and suppliers. This platform
empowers its users by facilitating the swift and efficient discovery of
products and suppliers for buyers. Additionally, it equips suppliers with
essential tools to access a global audience for their products</p>
